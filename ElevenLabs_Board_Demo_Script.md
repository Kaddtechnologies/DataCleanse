# Flowserve MDM Data Cleanse - ElevenLabs Board Demo Script
## Real-Time App Navigation Script

---

### **OPENING - Main Interface Introduction**
**Duration: 15 seconds**

"Good morning, Board members. Welcome to Flowserve's revolutionary AI-powered Master Data Management platform. What you're seeing is the future of enterprise data intelligence—a system that transforms thousands of duplicate customer records into strategic business insights in minutes, not months."

---

### **HEADER & SESSION MANAGEMENT**  
**Duration: 20 seconds | Navigate to: Header area, show Sessions button**

"Notice our executive-grade interface with intelligent session management in the header. Data stewards can save their progress, load previous analyses, and manage multiple data cleansing projects simultaneously. This enterprise-level session persistence ensures no work is ever lost, and teams can collaborate seamlessly across complex data initiatives."

---

### **FILE UPLOAD - 17K Records**
**Duration: 25 seconds | Navigate to: File upload area, select 17K customer file**

"Now I'm uploading our customer master file containing 17,000 records from multiple ERP systems. Watch as the system instantly detects the file structure and prepares for intelligent analysis. The AI automatically recognizes this is customer data and begins preparing optimal processing strategies."

---

### **INTELLIGENT SECTIONS APPEAR**
**Duration: 30 seconds | Navigate to: Help System, Blocking Strategy, Column Mapping sections**

"Once uploaded, you see three critical sections appear. First, our intelligent help system provides contextual guidance. Second, our processing strategy configuration—the AI selects the most effective algorithms for finding duplicates without overwhelming you with technical details. Third, smart column mapping where AI automatically detects customer names, addresses, and identifiers from any file format. Different files have different headers, but our AI handles this mapping intelligently, ensuring accuracy regardless of your data source."

---

### **START DEDUPLICATION BUTTON**
**Duration: 5 seconds | Navigate to: Click "Start Deduplication" button**

"Now we initiate the AI processing by clicking Start Deduplication."

---

### **PROCESSING TIME DISCUSSION**  
**Duration: 5 seconds | During loading overlay**

"While the AI processes our 17,000 records, it's analyzing millions of potential combinations using multiple algorithms simultaneously. The system processes name similarities, address matching, phonetic variations, and applies business intelligence rules to identify corporate relationships and subsidiaries that traditional systems miss entirely."

---

### **RESULTS APPEAR - EMPTY ROWS & BATCH OPERATIONS**
**Duration: 25 seconds | Navigate to: Results section, show invalid record detection**

"Excellent—results are ready. Notice how the AI automatically detected empty or invalid rows and gives us full control to discard them or keep them for manual review. For high-confidence matches—those with both AI and algorithmic confidence above 98%—we can merge them in batch operations, saving significant manual effort. This intelligent automation handles the obvious duplicates while flagging edge cases for human review."

---

### **DATA GRID & ROW IDENTIFICATION**
**Duration: 20 seconds | Navigate to: Interactive data grid, highlight row numbers**

"Moving to our data grid, each row has a unique identifier that corresponds exactly to the original Excel spreadsheet. Data stewards can click any row number to see exactly how that record appears in the source file—providing complete traceability and context for every decision."

---

### **CONFIDENCE LEVELS EXPLANATION**
**Duration: 15 seconds | Navigate to: Look for low confidence score example**

"Notice the confidence levels: High confidence above 98% for obvious duplicates, medium confidence 90-97% for likely matches, and low confidence below 90% requiring investigation. Let me find a low confidence example to demonstrate our review process."

---

### **CARD REVIEW MODAL OPENING**
**Duration: 20 seconds | Navigate to: Open card review modal**

"Opening our executive review interface. This modal provides side-by-side comparison with intelligent field highlighting. Green indicates identical matches, yellow shows differences, and amber highlights similar but not exact matches. This visual intelligence helps stewards make informed decisions quickly."

---

### **AI ANALYSIS REVOLUTION**
**Duration: 45 seconds | Navigate to: AI Analysis section in modal**

"Here's the revolutionary capability—our AI analysis powered by Azure OpenAI. The AI doesn't just compare text; it understands business context. Watch as it analyzes these records and provides detailed reasoning, confidence scoring, and actionable recommendations. The AI detects parent-subsidiary relationships, joint ventures, and corporate hierarchies based on concrete business rules embedded in the system. These business rules drive the AI to make contextually intelligent decisions that understand real-world corporate structures, not just text matching."

---

### **MARKING AS DUPLICATE**
**Duration: 10 seconds | Navigate to: Click "Confirm Duplicate" button**

"Based on the AI analysis and evidence presented, I'm marking this as a confirmed duplicate. The system immediately updates the record status and provides audit trail tracking."

---

### **EXPORT TO PDF**
**Duration: 25 seconds | Navigate to: Export actions, generate PDF**

"Finally, our decision-aware export system. This generates comprehensive HTML reports that translate our data steward decisions into specific ERP implementation guidance. The export tells your IT team exactly which records to merge, which to keep separate, and provides step-by-step instructions for SAP S/4 HANA implementation. This bridges the gap between data analysis and practical system deployment."

---

### **CLOSING IMPACT STATEMENT**
**Duration: 20 seconds | Navigate to: Return to main results view**

"What you've witnessed processes 17,000 records and identifies thousands of duplicates in minutes—work that traditionally requires months of manual effort. This AI-powered capability transforms every future acquisition, every data migration, every ERP consolidation into a competitive advantage. This isn't experimental technology—it's production-ready intelligence that positions Flowserve at the forefront of Industry 4.0 data management."
