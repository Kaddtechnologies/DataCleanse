# Business Rules Interface Redesign Plan

## Project Overview
Transform the current complex AI rule builder interface into a minimalistic, mobile-friendly sandbox environment that serves as an intuitive rule creation playground while maintaining professional workflow capabilities.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ **Solid Foundation**: Robust PostgreSQL schema, comprehensive APIs, TypeScript types
- ✅ **Executive Design**: Professional UI components with mobile-responsive patterns
- ⚠️ **Complex Interface**: Current rule builder has 4 complex components with overwhelming features
- 🎯 **Goal**: Streamlined sandbox with clear workflow sections and intuitive navigation

## Design Principles
1. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design prioritizing mobile/tablet experience
2. **Minimalistic**: Essential features only, eliminate visual clutter
3. **Sectional Flow**: Clear divisions guiding users through rule lifecycle
4. **Sandbox Feel**: Experimental playground while maintaining professional capabilities
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
